        <h1>Screenprint Website!</h1>
	<h3>By Adham Dweck</h3>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p id="background">In Mr Sinusas’ class, we were tasked with making a meaningful design for a box that involved something from our bodies. We had to have an audience we wanted to target, so we refined and differentiated our designs using Photoshop. Then, we used Illustrator to create a visual representation to see how it might end up.</p>

<h2>Explanation of My Drawing</h2>
<p>I was inspired by DJ Khaled, who believes in god and wanted to make it something. He said, "They didn't believe in us; god did.” Then, I needed something good to represent it, and I reenacted a photo of my favorite soccer player's (Mohammed Salah) celebration. My intended audience was people who didn't believe in themselves or were unmotivated and needed a little push from a quote.</p>

<h2>Camera introduction</h2>
<p>We started by looking at the camera settings to determine the different settings, what they do, and their drawbacks. Then, we took pictures of our hands, eyes, heads, arms, etc., to make cool designs. I decided to go with a 1/1000 (0.001s) and an F5.6 for the eye to contrast its dark environment and brighten it up. Then, for my hands, I need it just to have a shadow between my hands, so I decided to go for 1/250 and F5.6.</p>

<h2>PhotoShop Work</h2>
<p>We went into Photoshop with these pictures to add detail, change the color to use them, and make them the way we envisioned them. I cut out the parts I wanted using the lasso tool and magic wand to cut out the layers. Then I tried to add a filter that made it black and white and then used a halftone filter on the eye and hands to make the little contrast of colors.</p>

<h2>Building phase</h2>
<p>We used Illustrator to make a frame and other pieces needed, such as the screen and the actual design. Our next step was to set the frame up. I took a long piece of wood and measured out the size we needed, then used the saws to cut them out, then used glue and a stable gun to connect the wood pieces. After we measured out the mesh size we needed and started to stretch it out and stabilize it, we used those PNGs of single-color photos and printed them out. We had to pick out the details we needed and left things that would be the background color, and then we heated onto the mesh. We were ready to print!!!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>What I enjoyed the most about this project was the screen printing itself, combining the paint, and how satisfying it was when we used the squiggy to put the paint and how clean it came out. I demonstrated demonstration leadership by going in head first into things I had never done before and then helping my little behind friends. What was most challenging for me was stretching because it was annoying as it kept slipping from my hand, which was an obstacle I had to overcome, which I did with my groupmates. I might use these techniques if I ever needed to cut wood or something with screen printing. I'd have prior knowledge now.</p>

<h2>21 First Century Skill</h2>
<p>The skills I used a lot were problem-solving and critical thinking because when I was gluing my wood together, there was a massive gap that appeared even tho we had all the angles right and all the pieces were the same. Then I figured out one piece was off my small amount, but it almost ruined my whole project, so I had to come back and cut off a little more. Another thing was when I was picking out my Venial. It had such small details that it didn't get cut out, so my group mate and I helped each other by holding a piece that should have been cut out and having him cut it out.</p>
